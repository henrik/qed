## Dev

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

## Prod

Deployed to Fly.io. Just push to GitHub.

See `Dockerfile` and `fly.toml` for config.
