# Quoted Expression Demonstrator for Elixir

My first Phoenix app! Approaching this in a "first make it work, then maybe learn the proper way" fashion, but any feedback is super welcome.

## Dev

To start your Phoenix app:

  1. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  2. Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit <http://localhost:4000> from your browser.

## Test

    mix test

## Prod

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/deployment).
