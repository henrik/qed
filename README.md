[![CI](https://github.com/henrik/qed/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/henrik/qed/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

## Dev

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

## Prod

Deployed to Gigalixir. Just push to that remote.
